# WristAlert: Emergency Caregiver Bracelet
by Deniz Ulusel

## Summary
The toll taken by having to be vigilant at nighttime on home caregivers is a well researched issue [1][2][3]. Reported problems include sleep disorders and symptoms of clinical depression. WristAlert aims to ease these pressures on home caregivers by working with Bluetooth enabled medical continuous measurement devices such as pulse oximeters, blood pressure monitors or continuous glucose monitors. The vitals sent to WristAlert by the medical device are checked to ensure they are in a predefined "normal" range. When they are out of range, WristAlert wakes the home caregiver up by vibrating. As a result, caregivers can sleep sound knowing that they will be woken up in case of an emergency.
